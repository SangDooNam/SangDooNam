>Nam Sang-doo was born in Korea in the mid-1980s and was raised within the highly competitive society that can brand individuals as losers if they fail to meet narrow value expectations. As a result, he began to question the value system that underpinned such a society. Moreover, recent events like the coronavirus pandemic and the era of fake news in the digital environment have further contributed to his skepticism about the value created by illusions and the futile life that follows them.
This skepticism has resulted in a sense of resistance against illusions, leading him to dismantle the illusion-making technology of painting and instead use everyday items as his canvas, destroying them with paint. Returning to painting after a nihilistic period, he contemplates it in a new value context, connecting it with the human body and surrounding environment. Unlike the traditional process of painting that stops when completed, his paintings contain physical time as well as the illusion of the artist through performance, connecting the human body and the environment as an object.
Through his work, Nam Sang-doo highlights the presentness that we often overlook due to our preoccupation with illusions. His paintings point to the beauty of everyday life that we cannot see when blinded by illusions.
